## Introduction

This is a simple web application to support the admission process in the CS department at FSU. It is based on Rocket, the web framework for Rust. Rust is a (more) secure programming language.  

## Steps to deploy:
- Install the nightly rust and checkout the source code, build the release version of the server
- Create a directory for the server and copy the binary and related files to it
- Install `poppler-util`
- Allow the server to bind to privileged ports `setcap cap_net_bind_service=+ep server`
- Create a directory for the database and export it as `DATABASE_URL`
- Run the hash program compiled in the first step to create a new hash for your admin account
- Edit the `migration/init/up.sql` to included the hash and slat
- Run `diesel migration run` to create the database
- Generate a self-signed certificate `openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes`
- Start the server with `ROCKET_ENV=production ./server` under the Linux `screen` command.
